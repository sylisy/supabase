The Supabase Data API is a standalone server that sits between your application client code and your database. It automatically generates a fully RESTful API based on your database structure, allowing you to interact with your database through HTTP endpoints.

With the Data API, you have granular control over exposure: you can choose to generate API routes for specific tables, individual functions, or even entire schemas—depending on the needs of your application.

**Important:** Any table that is exposed through the Data API should have [Row Level Security (RLS) enabled](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) to prevent unauthorized data access.

## Expose specific tables and functions (recommended)

In [Data API integrations settings](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/data_api/settings), you can expose specific tables from specific schemas and grant only the privileges each role needs.

```sql
grant select on table public.your_table to anon;
grant select, insert, update, delete on table public.your_table to authenticated;
grant execute on function public.your_function to anon, authenticated;
```

## Use schema-level defaults for automation

If you need schema-wide automation, expose an entire schema like `public` or `api` and set default privileges for new objects:

```sql
alter default privileges in schema api
grant select, insert, update, delete on tables to anon, authenticated;

alter default privileges in schema api
grant execute on functions to anon, authenticated;
```

## Disable the Data API completely

If your app never uses Supabase client libraries, REST, or GraphQL data endpoints:

1. Go to [Data API integrations settings](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/data_api/settings).
1. Turn **Enable Data API** off.
