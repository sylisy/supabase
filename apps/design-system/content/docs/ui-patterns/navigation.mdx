Supabase has a necessarily complex navigation system to handle multiple products and levels of hierarchy. This page introduces those general patterns, best practices, and the components involved.

## Components

### NavMenu

A horizontal list of related views within a consistent PageLayout context, allowing for clearer page-level organisation. Activating a NavMenu item should trigger a URL change.

## Page titles

Browser page titles should follow a consistent most-specific-first structure so tabs and browser history are easier to scan:

`Entity | Section | Surface | Project | Org | Supabase`

Examples:

- `users | Table Editor | My Project | My Org | Supabase`
- `Backups | Database | My Project | My Org | Supabase`

Implementation notes (Studio):

- Use the shared title formatter in `apps/studio/lib/page-title.ts`
- Prefer `ProjectLayout` for project-scoped pages
- Treat `title` as the section label and `product` as the surface label
- Use `browserTitle.entity` for the most specific resource (table/function/query) when available
- Avoid assembling `document.title` ad hoc in individual pages/layouts
