A comprehensive guide to building on Supabase — from your first project to production. You'll learn how Database, Auth, Storage, Realtime, and Edge Functions work together, and how to use them confidently in your own applications.

## What you'll learn

- **Platform Architecture** — how Supabase is structured, when to choose it, setting up projects, and local development workflows.
- **Database Design & Postgres** — schema design, data types, functions, triggers, extensions, migrations, and replication.
- **Authentication & Users** — sign-up and login flows, authentication methods, user management, and security considerations.
- **Row Level Security** — RLS fundamentals, policy patterns, auth helpers, multi-tenancy, performance, and common pitfalls.
- **Storage** — architecture, access control, file operations, image transformations, and integration patterns.
- **Realtime** — subscribing to database changes, broadcast, presence, and real-world patterns.
- **Edge Functions** — architecture, development workflow, common patterns, database integration, and AI/LLM integration.
- **AI and Vectors** — vector fundamentals, indexing strategies, search patterns, and RAG implementation.
- **Production Readiness** — performance optimization, monitoring, security hardening, backups, and deployment patterns.

## Prerequisites

- A [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/) (free)
- Basic familiarity with a terminal

## Before you begin

Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), open the **Supabase Dashboard**, and grab your **API URL** and **API key** from the [Connect dialog](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks). You'll use them throughout the course to send real requests to your database and APIs.
