Data loss is one of the worst things that can happen to a production app. Supabase provides automatic backups and point-in-time recovery so you can restore your database if something goes wrong — a bad migration, an accidental delete, or a bug that corrupts data.

## Automatic backups

Supabase automatically backs up your database on a regular schedule. The frequency depends on your plan:

- **Free tier** — no automatic backups
- **Pro plan** — daily backups, retained for 7 days
- **Team and Enterprise** — daily backups with longer retention

Backups capture the entire database — all schemas, tables, data, functions, triggers, and extensions. They're taken automatically and don't require any action from you.

You can view available backups in the Dashboard under **Database > Backups**. Each backup shows when it was taken and its size.

## Restoring from a backup

If you need to restore, you can do it from the Dashboard. A restore replaces your current database with the backup, so everything in the database reverts to the state it was in when the backup was taken.

Before restoring, be aware:

- **It's a full replacement** — you can't selectively restore a single table. The entire database is rolled back.
- **Changes after the backup are lost** — any data written between the backup time and now will be gone.
- **Downtime** — there will be a brief period of downtime during the restore.

For most situations, a daily backup is sufficient. But if you need finer-grained recovery, that's where point-in-time recovery comes in.

## Point-in-time recovery (PITR)

PITR lets you restore your database to any specific moment in time — not just when a backup was taken. If a bad migration ran at 2:15 PM, you can restore to 2:14 PM and lose only one minute of data instead of an entire day.

PITR works by continuously streaming write-ahead logs (WAL) from your database. These logs record every change, so Supabase can replay them to reconstruct the database at any point.

PITR is available on Pro plans and above (as an add-on) and on Team/Enterprise plans. You enable it in the Dashboard under **Database > Backups > Point in Time Recovery**.

### When to use PITR vs regular backups

- **Regular backups** — good enough for most apps. If you can tolerate losing up to a day of data in the worst case, daily backups are fine.
- **PITR** — necessary when data loss needs to be measured in minutes, not hours. Important for apps with high-value transactions, financial data, or data that's hard to recreate.

## Manual exports

Beyond automated backups, you can export your database manually at any time using `pg_dump`:

```bash
pg_dump -h db.your-project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres > backup.sql
```

This creates a SQL file you can store wherever you want — version control, cloud storage, a local drive. It's useful for:

- **Pre-migration safety** — dump the database before running a risky migration
- **Moving data** — export from one project and import into another
- **Archival** — keep a copy outside of Supabase

To restore from a dump:

```bash
psql -h db.your-project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres < backup.sql
```

## Data portability

Since Supabase is built on standard Postgres, your data is fully portable. You can:

- **Export with pg_dump** and import into any Postgres database
- **Use logical replication** to stream data to another Postgres instance
- **Download Storage files** through the API or Dashboard

There's no proprietary format or lock-in. If you ever need to move away from Supabase, your data comes with you.

## Disaster recovery planning

Backups are only useful if you've thought about when and how to use them. A few things to plan for:

- **Bad migration** — a migration drops a column or table by accident. If you have PITR, restore to just before the migration ran. If not, restore the latest daily backup.
- **Accidental delete** — a user or admin deletes data they shouldn't have. Same approach — restore from backup or PITR.
- **Application bug** — a bug writes bad data to the database. This is harder because you might not notice immediately. PITR helps if you catch it quickly; daily backups help if you catch it within the retention window.
- **Compromised credentials** — if your Secret Key is exposed, rotate it immediately in the Dashboard. If unauthorized changes were made, restore from a backup taken before the compromise.

The key is knowing these options exist *before* you need them, so you're not figuring it out during a crisis.
