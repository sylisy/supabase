## Introduction

FizzBuzz is one of the most famous programming challenges, often used in technical interviews to test a developer's basic programming skills. In this post, we'll explore different implementations and discuss why this simple problem remains relevant.

## The Problem

The FizzBuzz problem is straightforward:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

## Implementation in JavaScript

Here's a classic implementation:

```javascript
function fizzBuzz(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('FizzBuzz')
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log('Fizz')
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('Buzz')
    } else {
      console.log(i)
    }
  }
}

fizzBuzz(100)
```

## Implementation in SQL

Since we love PostgreSQL at Supabase, here's how you can implement FizzBuzz using SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN num % 15 = 0 THEN 'FizzBuzz'
    WHEN num % 3 = 0 THEN 'Fizz'
    WHEN num % 5 = 0 THEN 'Buzz'
    ELSE num::text
  END AS result
FROM generate_series(1, 100) AS num;
```

## Why FizzBuzz Matters

While FizzBuzz might seem trivial, it tests several fundamental concepts:

1. **Loop constructs** - Understanding how to iterate
2. **Conditional logic** - Using if/else statements correctly
3. **Modulo operator** - Understanding remainders
4. **Order of conditions** - Checking the most specific condition first

## Conclusion

FizzBuzz remains a timeless programming exercise. Whether you're preparing for interviews or just warming up for a coding session, it's a great way to practice the fundamentals.

Happy coding!
